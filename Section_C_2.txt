Section C - 2:
Comparison the results of our program with sklearn's:

Sklearn models were faster than our models, there's a chance that they use parallelization (multiprocessing)
Regarding metrics, as shown in the sklearn documentation for each model, they use many hyper parameters, which may 
lead to better predictions in general (there was some cases where a model of ours had better predictions according 
to the measurements).
P.S: the output shows the differences in predictions, and the built in time function was used.
